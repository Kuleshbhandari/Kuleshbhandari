##  About Me

I am a field-driven researcher dedicated to exploring the dynamics of biodiversity and community ecology in tribal forest landscapes. My work bridges science and society by investigating ecological patterns that support conservation, health, and sustainability.

I engage in independent ecological research and contribute to national and international platforms through data sharing, scientific presentations, and open-access publications.
